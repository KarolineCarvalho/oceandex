He set sail from Spain on September 20, 1519, with five ships and 270 men. Along the coast, he sought out anyway through, failing several times until he ended up finding the strait along the tip of the continent, where Tierra del Fuego separates from the mainland. There, he discovered what’s now known as the Magellan Strait. It was on this journey, which was undertaken in order to circumnavigate the globe, the Magellan, also named the Pacific Ocean. When he entered into the new ocean waters, he found them to be unusually calm, inspiring him to name the ocean “Pacific,” from the Latin pacificus, meaning “tranquil.” ",
