## Project Description

"OceanDex" is a study project that aims to provide information about marine animals and curiosities about the oceans.

The inspiration for the name came from the concept of "Pokedex", an index / encyclopedia, which catalogs information about Pokemons.

Here, we gather general information about marine animals, their diet, their position in the food chain, their location points, among other curiosities.
